                <p>
                    <strong>Scenario:</strong> You are a cloud cybersecurity expert hired by an e-commerce company
                    that relies heavily on its website for customer sales. Today, you are tasked with responding
                    to a high-priority incident: multiple users report that they are unable to access the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Instruction:</strong> In this tutor software, you will follow the steps listed in the "Steps
                    to Complete" section in order to systematically analyze and respond to the incident.
                    Begin by clicking the first step <strong>"Investigate Incident Tickets"</strong>, to review the
                    initial information and interpret the problem.

Over-provisioned resources can lead to unnecessary expenses, especially during periods of stable traffic.
